Decision making:
* Decisions based on uncertainty: it's easy to decide based on 80% of the information, it's hard to decide based on 20%
* Step based on 10%-20% of information, fail, new information, new step usually > long decision making

Collecting information:
* Keep a contact with stakeholders and peers
* Fast diving in - fast getting back in order to keep a big picture view
* Keep involvement in all the areas in order to keep control
* Get an impression based on small amount of information: fetch a book summary based on 1 of 10 words

* Delegate things you know how to do & keep the rest
