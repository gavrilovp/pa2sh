[Here](https://github.com/gavrilovp/pa2sh) you can find tools and soil, and seeds I use to keep the garden going.

# Writing

Emacs. Plain markdown is my go-to right now, but I am going to give [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com) a try one day.

# Serving

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) transforms sources including markdown and settings into static website. [Hugo book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) with [Clinton Boys's tweaks](https://github.com/clintonboys/hugo-book) helps my garden to look beautiful and elegant.

[Goatcounter](https://goatcounter.com) collects some analytics without invading visitors' privacy.

Deploy process is based on github actions.

[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) supplies the domain name.

[Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) hosts the [NixOs](https://nixos.org) machine.

There is an alternative way: vercel (link to Sergey's garden).
