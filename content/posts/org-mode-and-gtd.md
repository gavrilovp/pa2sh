# Why?

* To be able to choose this or that.
* To ensure that long term stuff gets its attention.
* Relatively small bureacrucy cost.
* Keep the big picture and small details outside of the mind.
* Have chances to keep the ordering party informed in case the deadline is dead.

# Steps

1. Creation: `SPC X`. Just create. Do not deal with them just now.
2. Sit down each night and schedule/categorize those remembered tasks. Also, I move all completed tasks to the archive to clean up my todo file.
3. Getting ready for the day. `SPC o A` + `org-agenda-day-view`. Keep less than 5 tasks. Move everything else forward.
