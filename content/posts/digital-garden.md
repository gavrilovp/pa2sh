How gardens work? We put some efforts into them before they give us something (beatiful flowers and/or food) back.

This is the place where I would like to share some stories/photos/things I find interesting. I hope that fruits of this garden will be meaningful conversations, new people, so you are always welcomed to reach me out.

I was inspired by beautiful [Clinton Boys's garden](https://www.mtsolitary.com/). Reading through was like opening a box with treasures. Besides the content I liked the design so much that I decided to fork it to start my own garden.

Specifics:
* Graph with nodes & edges between them as an alternative to stream-like mediums -> various entry points & old posts do not fade into oblivion
* Dynamic as an alternative to static medium -> plant a seed then go back and finish / rewrite the nodes / reestablish connections
* Make stream out of a graph -> post, article, book or smth
* Navigation -> easy to explore adjacent topics
* Indie web -> unique structure, design & your own way to monetize your efforts if you want to as an alternative to platforms

New knowledge extraction:
* Connect ideas & domains -> use knownledge extracted in one in order to boost the different one & get an ability to generalize / going to the roots & same problem in various areas
* Log your and people's routes in your garden
* Find unobvious routes/connections (obsidian, chatgpt)
* Make it accessible to ChatGPT (LLM in general) or smth in order to have enough context / summarize it

Ideas:
* Music for garden -> slightly changing ambient soundscape depending on the knowledge cluster (closer the dots -- closer the music)
* Synthesed background -> the same logic as above

Here is the map with beloved gardens:
* https://mtsolitary.com
* https://garden-olive.vercel.app
* https://gwern.net
* https://kikanmassara.com -> write about the medium (art + science); MSU mathematic's book about topology with his paintings
* https://paulgraham.com
* https://nav.al
