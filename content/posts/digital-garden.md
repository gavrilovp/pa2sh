How gardens work? We put some efforts into them before they give us something (beatiful flowers and/or food) back.

This is the place where I would like to share some stories/photos/things I find interesting. I hope that fruits of this garden will be meaningful conversations, new people, so you are always welcomed to reach me out.

I was inspired by beautiful [Clinton Boys's garden](https://www.mtsolitary.com/). Reading through was like opening a box with treasures. Besides the content I liked the design so much that I decided to fork it to start my own garden.

Here is the map with beloved gardens:
