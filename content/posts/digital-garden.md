How gardens work? We put some efforts into them before they give us something (beatiful flowers and/or food) back.

This is the place where I would like to share some stories/photos/things I find interesting. I hope that fruits of this garden will be meaningful conversations, new people, so you are always welcomed to reach me out.

I was inspired by beautiful [Clinton Boys's garden](https://www.mtsolitary.com/). Reading through was like opening a box with treasures. Besides the content I liked the design so much that I decided to fork it to start my own garden.

Specifics:
* Graph with nodes & edges between them as an alternative to stream-like mediums -> various entry points & old posts do not fade into oblivion
* Dynamic as an alternative to static medium -> plant a seed then go back and finish / rewrite the nodes / reestablish connections
* Make a stream out of a graph -> post, article, book or smth
* Navigation -> easy to explore adjacent topics
* Indie web -> unique structure, design & your own way to monetize your efforts if you want to as an alternative to platforms
* Public & private parts
* The same concept described by various people with different background
* Links between wiki & private gardens

New knowledge extraction:
* Connect ideas & domains -> use knowledge extracted in one in order to boost the different one & get an ability to generalize / going to the roots & revealing the same problem in various areas
* Log your and people's routes in your garden
* Find unobvious routes/connections (obsidian, LLM)
* Get personalized AI assistance -> make it accessible to LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) in order to have enough context / summarize it
* Make it accessible to your supervisor in order to adjust a developing trajectory for you based on your boundaries / background / issues

Ideas:
* Music for garden -> slightly changing ambient soundscape depending on the knowledge cluster (closer the dots -- closer the music)
* Synthesed background -> the same logic as above
* Make it accessible to LLM in order to support / replace you as an expert in some cases
