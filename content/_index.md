Hey, my name is Pasha. Welcome to my [digital garden]({{< relref "posts/digital-garden" >}}).

You ask the beetle for directions. It seems excited to show you some possible paths:
* [books]({{< relref "posts/books" >}})
* [movies]({{< relref "posts/movies" >}})
* [series]({{< relref "posts/series" >}})
* [anime]({{< relref "posts/anime" >}})
* [clothing]({{< relref "posts/clothing" >}})

There are some pieces of paper on the wooden bench with Russian cursive entitled:
* [the tea trip]({{< relref "posts/tea" >}})
* [the tale about a fly]({{< relref "posts/fly" >}})

You see something that looks like [garden blueprints]({{< relref "posts/stack" >}}) near them.
